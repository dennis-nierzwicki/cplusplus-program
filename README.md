Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

This project’s design allows students to see how compound interest works in regards to savings accounts. The user can see what happens when they make a one-time deposit and compare it to a one-time deposit with additional monthly deposits.

What did you do particularly well?

This was my second attempt at defining a class structure in C++. While I think my code has a long way to go, devising a plan prior to coding seems to be the biggest accomplishment for this project. After sketching the basic flow, I was then able to add code with minimal issues. 

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

I feel like I still need some work on validating user input and the try/catch methods. My code can also be reduced to minimize repeating ideas. There has to be a point where you stop and feel happy with the structure and organization. 

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

My code started without returning anything as void print statements. Nothing needed to be passed in as the variables from the class were already set. After using the Sense tool, I reconfigured my code to allow variables to pass in. The refactoring was the most difficult part. I overcame this by starting with a blank slate and adding small pieces of code one by one until I had a setup I felt good with. 

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

The planning phase will immensely help with other additional and future projects. Up until this point, most assignments could be coded without any planning. This project made me take a step back and ‘bar napkin’ the ideas until I understood what needed to be acquired from the user and what needed to be passed point-by-point. 

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

The use of a class and object-oriented programming allow the program to be maintainable, readable and adaptable. By keeping everything compartmentalized in the object would allow additional functionality in the flow of this program. The comments help explain what is doing what making it easy for another programmer to see why I did what I did throughout the program.

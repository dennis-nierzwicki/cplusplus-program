## Project Summary

This project is designed to illustrate how compound interest works in relation to savings accounts. The application allows users to observe the effects of making a one-time deposit versus a one-time deposit with additional monthly deposits.

## Accomplishments

This was my second attempt at defining a class structure in C++. Although I believe my code has room for improvement, creating a plan before diving into coding was a significant achievement for this project. With a clear plan, I was able to add code with minimal issues.

## Areas for Improvement

- **User Input Validation:** I need to improve how I validate user input and utilize `try/catch` methods.
- **Code Efficiency:** The code could be optimized by reducing redundancy and consolidating repeated ideas.
- **Code Structure:** Finding the balance between a well-structured code and continuous improvement is crucial.

## Challenges and Solutions

The initial challenge was that my code started with `void` print statements, requiring reconfiguration to pass variables correctly. Using the Sense tool, I reworked my code to allow variable passing. This refactoring was challenging, but I overcame it by starting fresh and incrementally adding code until I achieved a functional setup.

## Transferable Skills

The planning phase of this project has been invaluable. It emphasized the importance of planning before coding, a skill that will benefit future projects and coursework. This methodical approach helps clarify user requirements and code flow.

## Code Maintainability, Readability, and Adaptability

The use of class and object-oriented programming has made the program more maintainable, readable, and adaptable. By compartmentalizing functionality within objects and including comments, the code is easier for others to understand and modify.




The use of a class and object-oriented programming allow the program to be maintainable, readable and adaptable. By keeping everything compartmentalized in the object would allow additional functionality in the flow of this program. The comments help explain what is doing what making it easy for another programmer to see why I did what I did throughout the program.
